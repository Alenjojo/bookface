# Contributing Guidelines

_See also: [Flutter's code of conduct](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/wiki/Style-guide-for-Flutter-repo#code-of-conduct)_

* Fork `https://github.com/CheshtaK/bookface` into your own GitHub account. If you already have a fork, and are now installing a 
development environment on a new machine, make sure you've updated your fork.
* Choose an open issue from the issue list and claim it in the comments.
* Create a branch specific to the issue you're working on, so that you send a PR from that branch instead of the base branch on your fork.
* If youâ€™d like to create a new issue, please go through our issue list first (open as well as closed) and make sure the issues you are reporting do not replicate the existing issues. 
* Follow the Issue and PR Templates provided.
